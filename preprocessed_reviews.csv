The banners are on the sides, let us explore on our own. Or have one card that shows a brief bit of them all and if we choose we can look or not. But red Xs and arrows. So troublesome. And again when you get low on rolls ü´®.",2024-11-10 12:18:04,Uncategorized

There is about 20 pop ups in the game... not even adds this is the ""Game"". Has an Auto-Roll... after like 2 rolls multiple pop ups go off and then you have to turn on the Auto again. The ""Game"" is unplayable because again in 5 minutes of playing over 4 minutes is just closing out pop ups",2024-11-12 12:06:41,Uncategorized

Several times I was supposed to be awarded with coins or rolls, but after the animation is over, nothing has been awarded! I hate cheating games!!! This game is super addictive. I love that I can either play to my hearts' content or wait a few hours for a good amount of turns. They are also available in the Google Play store rewards, so you can use points to get the stuff on sale in the app. Customer Service seems responsive too, no complaints so far.",2024-11-12 21:54:55,Uncategorized
7d087cea-3cb7-4f91-9e1c-7a48ef28f61f,Paul ‚ÄúTim‚Äù Blake,2,There needs to be an option to add friends from teams because it's impossible to add friends outside your own contacts. Secondly unless you pay pay pay you generally only get 4 or 5 spins in a 24 hr period. Thirdly all other side games fall back to the beginning everyday so it's impossible to get ahead in one and it's impossible to even grow a pet without paying.. it's a money game for sure and needs a lot of improvements,2024-11-09 21:30:48,Uncategorized
9bec4b97-6b5a-4654-9b10-789379a43371,MELISSA DITRI (Sweet Melissa),2,"Below is my initial 5-‚≠ê review of this game. And, although I still love the game, you can't really advance with pet or missions without spending A LOT of money. Even when you win you end up losing it all so quickly and have to buy more if you want to keep progressing. Great game for those who have a lot of money üí∞ to waste. ************* I LOVE THIS GAME! SO MANY DIFFERENT TOURNAMENTS, GREAT $ OFFERS, AND SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY WHEN YOU JUST WANT TO ESCAPE THE REAL WORLD FOR A WHILE! üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",2024-11-12 16:27:04,Uncategorized
8429f218-29fe-4b5f-8a24-3ba613343f3d,Jeff Malyan,5,Great game to pass the time away! Only thing I don't like is when on the trail it gives me dice on certain tiles! But it won't let me collect them! I've tried contacting customer service and one time they gave me a mystery gift to say sorry but I wasn't able to collect that either! I had 2994 rolls just a moment ago went back to the game and then to the trail again and I only had 1092 rolls! Why is that!,2024-11-08 20:05:53,Uncategorized
150fe859-038b-4712-ad69-5b4b28361031,Bryan White,3,I like this game a lot and can say I'm happily addicted the reason I give 3 stars is because I'm beyond annoyed with the pop up advertising for spending more money Everytime I run out of rolls. It's nice to be reminded that options are available but not every single time you roll. It's very annoying to have to exit out of 4 ads Everytime I run out of rolls and they seem to be purposely timed to create eagerness and prey on impatience in order to get more people to pay. Please change this.,2024-11-11 17:05:51,Uncategorized
348eb5b6-6a55-4516-b596-1efbd8ccbd7c,Miranda Wetzel Knoellinger,5,I love how you can watch videos for extra rolls. It's a game that you get hooked on easily! Fun game!! I started playing the game for rewards through my other apps! And now play it all the time. Support is awesome if there's a glitch they make it right so you don't lose out on rolls. This game exceeded my expectations in dice games. Just gets better and better,2024-11-10 02:12:52,Uncategorized
cf9de74e-d648-4635-85f7-be241eac924e,Anthony Mccoy,5,Best game ever!!! Definitely is addicting! Only problem is I had made some purchases and didn't get extra free rewards and when contacting hit and miss with response....well my problems were resolved after I figured out the proper way to get problem fixed...it wad taken care and promptly...me happy again...only thing I would ask is it so hard to upgrade farther in game if they could raise rewards sooner in game play and little more......Dice on'!,2024-11-09 06:58:11,Uncategorized
44ad23fa-4ccc-4937-948c-aa5a2cb3a254,Tracey W,4,"Occasional glitches but still a fun game. Glitches generally get worked out fairly quickly and if it caused you to miss rewards or prizes, just reach out to support. It may take a couple of days for them to get back to you but they're pretty good about resolving most issues. My biggest problem is not being able to send images to support in app. There's no option to allow it in permissions. I'm using a Galaxy S21, this causes me to eat $ sometimes because I don't have the patience to email.",2024-11-11 23:21:57,Uncategorized

Got the run around with adding new friends. They must have a Facebook to get credit for them. Currently I don't have the new trail. So sent yet another email. It's been over a week with no reply. It's really sad because I love the game. Oh! And when you do get close to competing something entirely too difficult, the game makes sure you pay to finish!! üòî",2024-11-11 06:46:54,Uncategorized

I love how the little characters run when you're getting ready to attack lol love it. Also I love how now it moves between different worlds and stuff automatically instead of having to do it yourself. Developers amazing job it's so cool.,2024-11-10 05:58:30,Uncategorized
89311335-c596-494c-9fc1-295a3042db8d,Steve Bennett,3,I like the game a lot but I took away 2 stars for the simple fact that when you open the app to play the game it won't let you until you go through all the stupid pop-ups and when you get low on dice it makes you go through the pop-ups again. Give it a break already and let a person just play the game and I'll spend money when I want to. You guys are ruining the game. Hopefully you change how that works before I stop playing completely,2024-11-08 09:16:35,Uncategorized
5182c2bd-dfb1-4f99-86b9-961b9fe7b614,PikAchiE,4,I love this game which I only started to play because of reward play. I still am playing it after I finished the required tasks in RP. I hate Chunk and the danger slot in the trails though. I also am very disappointed that I can never finish the pet stages so I have to start all over again. Other than those issues I generally enjoy the game.,2024-11-08 06:15:53,Uncategorized
8e1a96ae-af0f-4d7e-a01a-31be6442c64a,Virginia Fusilier,4,"I have been playing this game for several months now. I was skeptical at first, I'll be honest, but it is actually a really great game. The characters feel like they include you, have vibrant personalities and quirks, and while the graphics are really good, it's the *sound quality* that amazed me, truly. It's still one of my daily games and it will be for a long time. I wish they scaled their exponential gains to be more fair, but they give a lot and I'm often surprised by the wins in my favor.",2024-11-08 01:53:04,Uncategorized

So many popups and reward payout on events aren't really worth it.Support for this app sucks and will usually get a response within a week. By the time you get contacted back, whatever deal you wer cheated on will be gone. I've invited so many people yet have not received all rewards. And good luck adding photo evidence,. Eventhough you have it ,t won't be useful because you can't add the screenshot. The app doesn't allow you to. It's annoying üòë",2024-11-10 10:03:13,Uncategorized

The only way to get out of it is restart the game, but then whenever I do and I get the raid card it does the same thing again. It's really frustrating it won't let me do a simple mechanic.",2024-11-09 12:27:41,Uncategorized
ea77dec0-ef6c-4e1b-be61-a603a55e94eb,Tracy Mcadam,5,"This is a fun and easy game for a bit of down-time, and you do not have to think about anything. The rewards are usually generous, so you can play for free. If you want to purchase extra dice, there are usually deals for better value. Occasionally, it can be a bit glitchy. However, CS have always fixed any issues quickly. There are no ads (unless you watch a video for extra rolls). However, there are a LOT of pop-up ads for their daily deals etc - this can be annoying.",2024-11-10 05:08:39,Uncategorized

Still waiting over a month for them, game constantly turning off when loading up far too many events and offers. Game lags a lot for this reason also and to top it off, it's rigged so that you waste a lot of dice trying to get rewards especially when you've spent money for certain rewards.

This is a slots game disguised as a dice game. So many glitches, freezing, reseting and removing prizes. Basically a built in do-over. The algorithm's designed to make you spend, 5 players pay 6 different prices for the same exact packagesIf you win 100 rolls they take 150. My conclusion: Like a Casino the house always wins, and so does Dice Screams got money to waste? This is that game",2024-11-08 12:25:55,Uncategorized

And even then you get an error message 90% of the time saying that there's an error and you don't have an internet connection and you can't buy things. DUMB.

33dd3d2d-2a32-46fb-8949-448161755bc4,Tracy Raines,1,I just deleted my review that was 5 stars. I haven't played in a few days because you know life happens and I don't want to miss anything. I clicked on the game to play because I had some free time and noticed the ridiculous increase in price to buy rolls. I have made many purchases because prices were reasonable but you just lost a loyal player and supporter because of your greed.

Without friends you miss out on so much and I have reached out to support but nothing at all! Such a shame. You are better off playing monopoly go it's the exact same game but everything works and monopoly is not greedy with the dice like this game and they don't completely bombard you with in game purchase offers non stop like dice dreams!,2024-11-08 22:08:07,Uncategorized
3b3fe843-9ab2-4250-a59c-755e854c75ac,Stylish Home Designs,1,DON'T add people from Facebook friends because there is NO way to remove them. HUGE flaw with this game is they don't allow you to remove friends. People will start spam attacking you. You have to buy rolls to have as many chances to attack them back. I added someone who plays all night and day. He buys rolls to keep attacking. One or two stacks is fine but this game and support allows people to abuse the friend option. I'll be deleting the whole app since they don't allow to you remove people.,2024-11-11 13:40:41,Uncategorized
