The video mania many times doesn't work. It's fun when it runs as intended, but unfortunately, that's becoming a rare experience. Update 11-1-24 Yesterday I made it to 3 chest on the trail and didn't get the rewards. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game this morning because it won't completely load. The game still won't load. It's frustrating because it is a fun game when it works. It's been hours and the game isn't loading.",1,15,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-02 00:43:08,"Thanks for the feedback and sharing your game experience!

I can't anymore with the bugs and glitches. I'm on a great team, and the tournament keeps disappearing. I lose progress or items. I have spent money on this game, and it is upsetting that support will not honor lost items when you have paid for them! I'm close to deleting the app altogether and not playing anymore.",3,3,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-04 01:43:14,"Thanks for the feedback and sharing your game experience!

You do get sucked in and really start spending money after more and more levels. After you get further in you should get more options for ways to get more free rolls or cookies or ways to continue instead of having to pay to play. Obviously the person playing enjoys the games or they wouldn't be playing, there should be more rewards and less asking for money as levels progress to enjoy the game.",5,1,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-05 10:16:12,We appreciate hearing your feedback.

Just the last time I played I counted 8 pop ups before I could even do anything. Then I was able to roll 3x and more pop ups freezing my screen. I actually left the game to leave this review because it's that frustrating. These pop ups are extremely redundant and annoying. If I want to invite a friend, I know how... Thanks smh",2,0,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-05 18:38:48,,

Love the game when it runs right but constantly updating the game because of so many glitches. It can be very frustrating waiting for them to correct the issues or having them just ignore your issues altogether.",1,14,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-03 02:19:10,"Thanks for the feedback and sharing your game experience!

Game is opening and crashing asking to restart. Tried to reinstall but issue remains. Update. Issue got resolved, new come up but addressed swiftlt, seems to occur more after updates. Been playing for 3+ years multiple devices. New issue reported today with in app purchases, hope it will be resolved soon.",3,1,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-04 12:59:21,"Thanks for the feedback and sharing your game experience!

AND 1.2B to finish a level is crazy! Just about done with this game unless things change. There has to be better games out there. Still playing this game but I think it STINKS that you offer us all the ""pearls"" for the deep dive game but then we can only go 2 levels without buying the next level! I will NOT pay to play a game and this really is wrong!",1,1,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-04 01:41:58,"Thanks for your review, A!

You can't finish literally any event unless you pay to do so. You also can't remove friends from your list which you HAVE to add people to trade so if you add someone to trade and they nonstop attack you you're screwed. Too bad. Can't remove them unless you delete your account. Other games with the same concept might not look as nice but go about things wayy better than this game like coin master. It's fun but annoying if you're free to play,1,5,1.83.3.22303,2024-11-04 19:47:30,"Thanks for your review, Charlotte!
