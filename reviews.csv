Lately, I complete it, but come back the next day, and it's not completed, and I've had millions stolen from me. Other glitches include the button getting stuck when doing a raid. UPDATE: I've been experiencing different glitches now. I have the most updated version. I have reached out to support several times, but never hear back.",2024-11-15,Uncategorized

There is about 20 pop ups in the game... not even adds this is the ""Game"". Has an Auto-Roll... after like 2 rolls multiple pop ups go off and then you have to turn on the Auto again. The ""Game"" is unplayable because again in 5 minutes of playing over 4 minutes is just closing out pop ups",2024-11-12,Uncategorized

Several times I was supposed to be awarded with coins or rolls, but after the animation is over, nothing has been awarded! I hate cheating games!!! This game is super addictive. I love that I can either play to my hearts' content or wait a few hours for a good amount of turns. They are also available in the Google Play store rewards, so you can use points to get the stuff on sale in the app. Customer Service seems responsive too, no complaints so far.",2024-11-12,Uncategorized
150fe859-038b-4712-ad69-5b4b28361031,Bryan White,3,I like this game a lot and can say I'm happily addicted the reason I give 3 stars is because I'm beyond annoyed with the pop up advertising for spending more money Everytime I run out of rolls. It's nice to be reminded that options are available but not every single time you roll. It's very annoying to have to exit out of 4 ads Everytime I run out of rolls and they seem to be purposely timed to create eagerness and prey on impatience in order to get more people to pay. Please change this.,2024-11-11,Uncategorized
b9aef211-13e7-4f53-af89-b2715986dee8,Eileen,5,The graphics are excellent and game play moves along at a brisk pace. Pricey.üëç Update rewards are satisfying. I'd like to have a fifteen minutes unlimited rolls as a roll reward once a day. And make Free Rolls earn free rolls. Just give us more rolls. No way we can finish challenges or missions without spending $$ we don't have. Rewards are more generous so far today. Keep up the momentum.,2024-11-14,Uncategorized

Glitches generally get worked out fairly quickly and if it caused you to miss rewards or prizes, just reach out to support. It may take a couple of days for them to get back to you but they're pretty good about resolving most issues. My biggest problem is not being able to send images to support in app. There's no option to allow it in permissions.

You do more waiting on reloading lives than actual game play. There's way too many pop-ups asking to pay for coin/ lives. I gave those 2 stars because there are no commercials You wait a whole day for a full reloading of lives and you're lucky if half your rolls hit anything or enough to build.

The peons are cute, especially when they're running away from an attack. The rolls take quite a bit of time to refill but free rolls come from random places. It's a fun pass time and engaging. The last album tournament felt very rigged against the player. The game is currently less user friendly and it's becoming a drag",2024-11-13,Uncategorized

So my initial interest got smoldered out .Then it turned into disinterest like if it works when I open it fine if it doesn't who cares ? So I sort of experienced this instead of the attraction of the game . It was attractive I was just trying it out though .So nothing ventured nothing gained .‚òÑÔ∏è,2024-11-14,Uncategorized

HUGE flaw with this game is they don't allow you to remove friends. People will start spam attacking you. You have to buy rolls to have as many chances to attack them back. I added someone who plays all night and day. He buys rolls to keep attacking. One or two stacks is fine but this game and support allows people to abuse the friend option. I'll be deleting the whole app since they don't allow to you remove people.,2024-11-11,Uncategorized
